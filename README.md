# GWT Boot: Starters

## GWT BOMs and POMs - GWT Dependencies and Starters

GWT Boot is basically a simple Starter dependencies collection 
just like Spring Boot Starter dependencies.

GWT Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors 
that you can include in your application. 
You get a one-stop-shop for all the GWT and related technology 
that you need without having to hunt through sample code and 
copy paste loads of dependency descriptors. For example, 
if you want to get started using GWT and [Domino UI](https://github.com/vegegoku/domino-ui) 
for your Material Design and [Elemental2](https://github.com/google/elemental2) just include the 
spring-boot-starter-ui-domino dependency in your project, 
and you are good to go.
